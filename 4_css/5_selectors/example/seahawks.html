                <h1>Team History: Seahawks</h1>
                <p>Core values: The Seahawks organization is guided by overall principles of acceptance and
                    understanding that help us create a culture of respect, equality and inclusiveness both on
                    and off the field.</p>
                <p>We, as an organization and as individuals, represent and respect a wide range of human differences,
                    personal experiences and cultural backgrounds.</p>

            <p>When the Seattle Seahawks took the field for the first time in the 1976 season, it marked the
                culmination of a quest for a National Football League franchise that had its roots in the
                Pacific Northwest metropolis as early as 1957. That is when discussion first began about the
                possibilities of constructing a domed stadium that would assure a major league sports franchise
                for the city. On June 4, 1974, the NFL awarded its 28th franchise to Seattle to play in the
                64,984-seat Kingdome.</p>
            <p>A civic suggestion campaign netted 20,365 entries and 1,741 different names, but "Seahawks"
                was selected and announced on June 17, 1975. Just a little more than two months later, after
                a 27-day sale, the season ticket campaign was shut off with 59,000 tickets sold.</p>
            <p>On January 3, 1976, Jack Patera, who had been a Minnesota assistant coach, was named the team's
                first head coach. The Seahawks finished 2-12 in 1976, when they played in the NFC, and 5-9 in 1977,
                when they moved into the AFC. The Seahawks had winning 9-7 records in both 1978 and 1979 and
                Patera was named NFL Coach of the Year the second year.</p>
